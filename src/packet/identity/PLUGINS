Specification for identity protocol plugins:

Each plugin is a python module defining at a minimum three different functions:

identify(Packet packet, int offset) : None
prototype(str attrstr) : ProtocolIdentity
modify(Packet packet, ProtocolIdentity prototype) : None

 - identify:
    This function takes two arguments, a Packet object, and offset.
    Packet is the packet that's being identified, offset is the
    byte offset to the start of the current header (i.e. payload of transport).
    This function should append a ProtocolIdentity to the packet's identity
    list, then call the next appropriate, if any, identify function.

 - prototype:
    This function takes a single argument, a string; and produces from it
    a ProtocolIdentity either similar to, or simpler than one produced by
    identify function.

 - modify:
    This function takes three arguments, a packet to modify, an identity index and
    a prototype. The function should alter the packet in such a way that subsequent
    calls to the identify function should produce a prototype that matches the
    one provided. The function should also update the identity of the packet
    accordingly (presumably by doing a 'dict.update') and if the size of the packet
    has changed, update the origlen and all subsequent ProtocolIdentity offsets of
    that packet.
